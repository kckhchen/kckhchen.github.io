        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am <strong>Kuan-Hung Chen</strong>. You can also call me <strong>Casey</strong>. I recently graduated from University of Warwick with a MSc degree in Statistics. Before this, I graduated from National Taiwan University, double-majoring in Economics and Foreign Languages and Literatures.</p>
        <p>I'm a passionate data scientist with a keen eye for market insights and consumer behavior, equipped with strong language skills. My professional interest lies in extracting useful insights from messy data and visualization. Aside from my technical background, I'm also a freelance English-Mandarin (Traditional) subtitle translator by interest. I have worked on various projects ranging from game shows to popular TV series and feature-length films.</p>

              </h3>
              <p>I joined Kantar Worldpanel as an intern and worked with a 20-person team to develop FMCG market insights and provide our clients with useful and actionable growth strategies. Due to my strong performance, I was entrusted to independently manage a client report and present the findings directly to the client. In my spare time, I created 10+ Excel and PowerPoint VBA macros and Python scripts (as side projects) to help boost the workflow. Those tools turned tedious, repetitive manual tasks that took up hours of our team's time into one-click automations that run in seconds. Those automation tools have now been incorporated into the company's day-to-day operations and training manuals for newcomers.</p>

        <h2>My MSc Dissertation</h2>
        <p>My MSc dissertation, under the supervision of Dr. Ritabrata Dutta, is titled "<a href="./assets/docs/msc-dissertation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Probabilistic Weather Forecasting with Recursive Algorithms and Vine Copulas</a>". It explores the possibility of applying an efficient nonparametric recursive marginal density estimation method to time-series data and utilising vine copulas, a statistical tool to model multi-dimensional copulas and evaluate their densities, to estimate complex nonlinear temporal dependence structures in time series. In this dissertation, the algorithm has been proven to be effective in making probabilistic forecasts on geopotential weather data.</p>
